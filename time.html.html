  <p>June 06 2021, Saturday Afternoon.. Hello there, this message is similar to a time capsule, i know na pag dumating yung right time mababasa mo rin to, but before i proceed let me introduce my self, Hi Lime!! I'm zayn:) for full details Zayn Aly Ziones Zacanne Zennisca Mendez and i'm currently 17 years old, tangalin na natin yung "Zaccane" masyadong mahaba and hindi ko rin naman ginagamit sa display name ko Hahaha, but anyways baka mamali ka ng pronunciation, (zane?ze-yn) ang tamang pag bigkas sa pangalan ko. For sure nagtataka ka now kung sino ako at bakit lime ang tawag ko sayo, "lime" ang nickname mo sakin hindi ko pa kasi alam ang name mo and since yan ang hawak ko that time edi yan nalang muna itatawag ko sayo hanggat sa makilala kita at malaman ko name mo in the future T^T, pretty weird right? Hahahahha. Im writing this message as a confession and also for future purposes narin, pagod na pagod ako ngayong araw alam mo ba? Ilang oras kong sinundan yung ate ko mag libot libot, and ngl super annoying ng big sister ko, inuutusan ba naman ako minu-minuto!! Kainis kaya. Ikaw? may big sister ka rin kaya? Excited na akong makilala ka at malaman lahat tungkol sayo. Kakautos ng ate ko sakin sobrang naging sunod sunuran ako umabot na ako sa point na halos mahimatay na ako kakabuntot sakanya, pero alam mo simula ng maging special tong araw na to hindi na ako nag rereklamo sa mga pinapagawa sakin hahahaha, kaninang tanghali 3:30 PM naglalakad ako kasama ate ko ng may nakita akong boy,  ang kyut niya to be honest sobrang kyut as in (cute) baka hindi mo maintindihan yung word na "kyut" in the future eh, pero hindi ko talaga alam, bakla ba ako? oyyy hindi normal makyutan sa kapwa lalaki ah, bakla na ata ako Hahahaha hindi ko tanggap, mapapatay ako ng magulang ko kapag nalaman nilang bakla ako, pero paano ako magiging bakla nag kakagusto parin naman ako sa babae?

I felt as though the cosmos had joined forces to present me to someone whose very presence aroused my curiosity. Your genuineness smile and charm left a lasting effect, and i can imagine that  every word you spoke and glance you shared seemed to reveal new levels of fascinating nuance. I was struck by your real goodness lime, your engaging brilliance, or your contagious zest for life, among other aspects of your personality that I found to be extremely relatable. My admiration for you surged up like a gentle wave, driven by the knowledge that even though we had only recently met, this feeling of mine had a magnetic attraction that went beyond simple acquaintanceship. During those first few seconds, i know that i am falling for you, the first time i laid my eyes on you alam ko na we're meant for each other.

</p> June 08 2021 Monday, Madaling araw kakagising ko lang, nag sususulat ako ngayon sa diary ko dahil may strange na nangyare, nanaginip ako! hindi basta bastang panaginip ah, ang gulo gulo nito, paano ba naman kasi sinong hindi ma we-weirdohan kapag nanaginip ka ng tao? i mean not just any regular person, yung tipong feeling mo kilala mo siya o nakita mo na? to be honest halos bangangutin na ako dito dahil ayaw kong kumawala sa panaginip ko, na starstruck ako sa taong yun, Hahahhahaha what is happening to me nung nakaraang araw lang ay nababaliw ako sa lalaking naka salubong ko ngayon ay nag mumukha na akong tanga sa lalaking nasa panaginip ko? Shocks confirmed bading ako!Hahhahaha nag kakaroon na ako ng attachment sa ka same gender ko? Binibigyan ko na ng meaning lahat ng mga walang ka kwenta kwenta at non sense na bagay, maybe baliw nga talaga ako after all. But i wonder who's that guy on my dreams, he really looks familiar, huhuhu paano kung si lime din yun? kung paano siya maglakad, kung paano siya mahagip ng golden hour vibes of sunlight, siya na siya talaga naaalala ko, but the best part of my fream na hindi ko malimut limutan is when he leaned his head to my shoulder and then i stared deeply into his eyes, i sat up and we kissed. Do you know how strange this dream is??? kissing a stranger without seeing his whole entire face? hell nah, nababaliw natalaga ako.</p>

</p>Guess what I'm unfortunate today lime, Don't you know I have this dream again, but my concern here is, it's the same fricking guy I dreamed of last time, is this a coincidence or am I losing it. This time the scenery and ambiance of my dream is something you cannot explain, ang redundant Hahahahha. I finally know his name he told me that i should call him "Yg" nalang, i can say na ang ganda ng name niya, pero seryoso ba siyang Yg lang or nickname lang, ganundin kasi sakin Ly ang tawag sakin ng iba shortened ng "Aly". Namamaga mata ko ngayon kakaiyak, sobrang iba ang feeling ko nung nayakap ko siya sa panaginip ko, hindi ko rin alam ang rason bakit ako naiiyak, this mysterious man emerged as if conjured by the whims of the subconscious. I cannot describe this man lime kung alam mo lang. Dappled in a ghostly light, he moved with a strange elegance through the dream-like environments of my thoughts. He had eyes that could have revealed the secrets of universes and a face that radiated wisdom beyond measure. His features were a mysterious fusion of familiarity and mystery. The air around him seemed ghostly, tinged with the colors of dreams gone by and unknown paths ahead. A trail of echoes that persisted long after waking up emanated from his presence as he traveled through my dream. This figure turned into a magical person defied reality and imagination in the world of my dreams lime, he represented the secrets that exist in the darkest corners of the human psyche. I can say that you lime and yg are not so different. You both captured my heart in just a few seconds. I am being for real today. Hindi ko maexplain ano ba itong taong to saakin.</p>

Hi Lime tanghaling tapat naka sama ko si Yg sa panaginip ko, dinalaw niya nanaman ako kahit gusto ko lang naman umiglip, alam mo bang nag date kami ngayon Hahahhaha, everything felt so reallll. Do you know kung gaano ako kasaya ngayon? Picnic date sa tabi ng dagat ang nais ah, nasa white sand kami, Under the azure sky and crashing waves, we found consolation in the simple beauty of the ocean. The sun, lowering towards the horizon, provided a glow over the sandy shoreline, where we spread a checkered blanket with a variety of appetizing snacks. As we laughed and told stories, the  breeze carried the smell of the sea along with the aroma of freshly prepared meals. The steady murmur of the waves created a calm background for our private moments. With bare feet in the soft sand, I and yg savored the taste of summer fruits and relished the sweetness of shared gaze. As the sun began to set, we watched the sun fall below the horizon, coloring the sky with orange and pink. Do you even realized how magical it is?  I don't know why I am writing this to our time capsule Lime. I think this diary of mine became my comfort just to escape reality. One day you're going to read this. (kung mag meet tayo) </p>

 </p> Hi Lime no dreams today:<, I'm starting to miss you and yg Hhahahahahahhaa, if you ever saw this in the future wag ka mag seselos ha, Yg is a completely fictional person while you're a real one. I'm trying to continue our story in my dreams so I can make a story about it in the future, you wanna know why? You know Lime, Every night, as I close my eyes and surrender to my dreams, I am transported to a world where the ordinary becomes exceptional. In this domain of fantasy, I am more than simply a dreamer; I am a storyteller who creates stories that go beyond the limits of reality. As I explore the landscapes of my mind, I see a future in which my pen can craft narratives that captivate hearts and minds. In these midnight reflections, the smell of achievement and the taste of accomplishment linger in the air, fueling my ambition to become a great writer. The characters I create, the scenarios I devise, and the emotions I make in these visions all feed my imagination. Each night, my desire to step into the spotlight grows stronger, motivating me to pursue that  vision and make it an actual reality. I want you to be by my side, while I am achieving my dreams Lime, So I look forward to meeting you in the future. </p>

</p>  "NARRATIVE ESSAY: DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?" - ZAYN MENDEZ."


The phenomenon of love at first sight is often dismissed as a romantic notion, reserved for fairy tales and fiction. However, there are instances when a chance encounter with a stranger can have a spark that transcends the person and souls into uncharted emotional mind. It was such an encounter that left a mark on my heart, compelling me to entertain the idea of pursuing a connection with a person who, until that moment, had been a stranger.

The scene unfolded in a crowded street, where the ambient hum of conversation and the aroma of the nearby beach created an atmosphere of warmth and familiarity. Amidst the sea of faces, my gaze was inexplicably drawn to a stranger whose eyes met mine in a collision of glances. In that  moment, time seemed to suspend, and a connection appeared, sparking an undeniable sense of interest in him.

It is often attributed to physical attraction, and indeed, this encounter was no exception. The stranger possessed an high magnetism, an aura that resonated with an inexplicable looks. It wasn't just their physical features but the energy they exuded, a unique blend of confidence and structure that captured my attention and refused to let go.

In the aftermath , a cascade of emotions overwhelmed me. The rational part of my mind urged caution, reminding me that pursuing a stranger based on a single glance was wrong and potentially fraught with disappointment. However, the more whimsical side of my standard, fueled by the romantic notion of destiny, urged me to risk the possibility of them being your soulmate.

The unknown and the promise of that glances turned the encounter into a daydream. Thoughts of the stranger occupied my mind, and the desire to unravel the mystery of our connection grew stronger with each passing day. It wasn't just a physical attraction; it was a fascination with the aura of the person behind the gaze, the stories untold, and the time that made them meet.

Admiring a far with a stranger carries an inherent risk—one that acknowledges the unpredictable nature of human connections. Yet, the heart, with its penchant for love, yearns to explore the possibility of them, seeing each other in the future. It becomes a journey of another, a leap of faith that challenges the boundaries of two person.

The decision to pursue love at first sight necessitates a delicate balance between the head and the heart. Practical considerations vie with the intoxicating view of romantic standard. Conversations with friends yield of advice, ranging from cautionary tales of misplaced infatuation to uplifting anecdotes of love that defied logic 
attractions. 

So I have come to a realization, that the time of pursuing a stranger based on a love-at-first-sight encounter is an interplay of emotion and reason. While the practical mind may advocate caution, the romantic heart yearns for the possibility of something. It is a journey that requires patience,, courage, and a willingness to find each other.  Whether it leads to a connection or remains just an encounter in life, the fact of love, at first sight, is a trils to the enduring saying  of romance and the belief that, sometimes, love begins with a single glance. </p>

Gusto ko nalang umiyak e. Sa mga araw na sinosolo ko lahat ng problema ko para akong tanga sa kwarto ko, im dealing it all on my own. Kaya i am very grateful na nakasalubong kita nung araw na yun, binalik mo yung ngiti ko lime, simula nung araw na yun mas naging interested ako sa pagiging successful in the future. I want to see you, kaya pinangako ko sa sarili ko na hahanapin kita. Kahit abutin pa ako ng taon, hahanapin kita lime and i promise you, once na hanap kita. I will marry you.

</p> Naiiyak ako, eto nanaman ako sa phase na to, bata bata ko pa pero pinag plaplanuhan na agad yunh kasal kasal na yan, tangina. Bawal ba ako tumanggi, kahit ngayon lang? Arrange Marriage:( Ayoko lime, ayoko sa babae, the idea of having one's life partner chosen by others can be daunting for me who prioritize personal agency and the freedom to explore connections organically. Hindi to kasama sa plano ko sa buhay, ayoko na iba ang gumagawa ng kwento ng buhay ko pero wala akong magawa lime, wala akong choice, napakahina ko, hindi ko kayang mag reklamo. Life is so unfair. Nakakaiyak lang lime kasi sa pamilya kong to ako nalang palagi ang pang solution nila, dahil sa letcheng utang nila na yan ako magiging bayad? WOW okay sige sabihin na nating 7 years pa, paano kung sa mga oras na yun may mahal na ako? Paano kung iba ang gusto ko pakasalan? Ang hirap hirap talaga. I have always believed in my desire for autonomy in choosing a life companion is often chosen by the belief that love should be a free-flowing in emotion rather than useless arrangement.I wanna break free from the constraints of opinions or societal conventions for evry persons one's true self and the judgement of your family members. Pagod na pagod na ako sa buhay ko, i wanna rest lime, pero hindi pwede dahil andiyan ka pa, hahanapin pa kita:< </p>

</p> One of the toughest things to do is be patient with yourself. To silently stay committed to your goals without being discouraged that there's no sign to tell you that you're on the right pach. To keep moving forward even if you're not getting rewarded in any way yet. Most times, we give up after trying for a while because we think we're failing in some way only because our efforts aren't manifesting into a solid win. I am wrong for doing that. Every day I choose to continue working hard towards my goals, I get a step closer to achieving them. Every time I encourage my self to believe in my ability to conquer instead of giving in to doubt, I earn ymyself a little victory right there. I just wanna give you some updates about my life because i am improving lately, so we both can read this in the future Hshshahahha, I miss you lime. </p>

</P>As I sit down to express these feelings, I find myself transported back to that moment when I first laid eyes on you – a recollection that is so vivid in my mind. Everything around me faded into the background as if time had stopped for a moment. Your face, with its distinct charm, captured me in a way that is difficult to describe. The emotion was so strong that it felt as if fate had engineered our meeting at that exact moment. Your smile lit up the room, and the real sparkle in your eyes left an indelible mark on my heart. Since that day, I haven't stopped thinking about your face. It has become a source of comfort, a mental 
shelter that I return to when life's hardships get too much. I miss the sight of it, the way your eyes crinkle when you smile, and the small details that distinguish you. Merry Christmas my love, how can I forget to greet you? You're the first person I greeted today. Please take care, and I hope you're doing well. Enjoy your Christmas lime! </p>

</p> "WAITING" (ZAYN MENDEZ)


Love is a complicated and varied feeling that frequently defies logic and reasoning. It can strike us unexpectedly, taking us by surprise and transforming our lives in an instant. While conventional wisdom suggests that love takes years to grow, there are times when a single meeting can kindle a profound connection in our hearts, reigniting the flame of patient attachment.

Imagine meeting someone only once and having an unexplained connection that resonates deep within your soul. In these rare cases, the heart appears to perceive a kindred spirit, resulting in a unique link. In that instant, the seed of love is planted, and the journey that follows is one of waiting patience, and hopeful anticipation of a reunion. The force of that first encounter is at the heart of loving and waiting for someone. It's as if destiny choreographed the unexpected encounter, leaving an impression on both those involved. The recollection of that brief moment serves as a source of inspiration, instilling a sense of longing and wonder about what can emerge from such an accidental meeting.

One could argue that waiting for someone based on a single meeting is a sign of craziness, However, it is precisely this feeling that gives the experience such depth. The heart, frequently guided by intuition, senses something exceptional in that connection, urging an individual to embrace the uncertainty and patiently await a second.

The act of waiting becomes a type of devotion, demonstrating the conviction that love knows no bounds. It goes beyond the traditional boundaries of acquaintance and familiarity, daring to create a bond that defies society's expectations. This patient's love is not dependent on the frequency of reunions, but rather on the depth of the emotional resonance established in the first encounter.

In the context of waiting for love, time has a new meaning. Days pass into weeks, weeks into months, and the heart patiently awaits a reunion. During this time of waiting, emotions may ebb and flow, but the essence of the connection remains constant. It is a journey marked by belief in the power of love to withstand the test of time.

Waiting for someone after a brief acquaintance may appear unusual to others, but it demonstrates the patience and lesson that love can bring into our lives. The road of patient love requires us to trust our intuition and recognize that the heart has its sense of timing.

 Loving and waiting for someone you've just met once demonstrates the power of love. It acknowledges that connections can be both instantaneous and magical, capable of transcending time and societal expectations. The path of patient love is a wonderful monument to the enduring anatomy of the human heart and its ability to traverse the complexities of emotions in the quest for a connection that feels destined to be.

Happy Valentine's Day my love, May you feel the love in all its forms, bringing a smile to your face and a glow to your heart. </p>

</p> Today is my moving up ceremony lime, and I  graduated high school with the highest honors. Nag bunga lahat ng pagod ko, how i wish makita kita ngayon, for sure  moving up niyo na rin this month. Kamusta ka na kaya? Ano na kaya istura mo ngayon? 1 year nalang lime, 1 year na lang. Konting panahon nalang at makikita na kita. Kailangan ko maging strong dahil hindi ko na alam kung kakayanin ko pa lime. Nag mumukha na akong baliw, ikaw ang nagiging rason ko para tapusin pa ang taon na to. Sobrang pagod na ako, pero i guess ito na ang reason kung bakit tayo nag tagpo. Ikaw ang naging inspiration ko para ituloy yung daan na tatahakin ko. I am so grateful sa pangyayareng yon and until this day. hoping to see you soon lime! </p>

</p> There are things I cannot control and memories I can never erase, and in the times I don't feel whole, I will always search for your face.
You are every star burning in the sky, you are every golden leaf in the tallest tree, you are a pattern, a snowflake, and every firefly, and I will still love you even when we're eighty-three.I will stand by you in every new day even when people seem so unkind
because you are special despite what they say and you are everything I've wanted to find.
For all the places in which we go for one day you might be my soulmate, I think we both already know I am yours in every life.. </p>

</p> Happy 1 year!! 1 year na akong nag hihintay sayo LIMEE! and good news bumalik sa panaginip ko si yg. After so many months biglang nag paramdam, ang weird no? Anyways, sa falls kami ngayon. Pinapanood ko lang siya sa panaginip ko, he's face is still blurry as usual. I dont know pero ang comforting niya makasama sa panaginip ko kahit hindi ko siya makilala, kasing comforting nung unang kita ko sayo. Kung hindi nga kalayuan ay iisipin kong iisa lang kayo ni Yg eh pero hindi, hindi naman pwedeng ganun. HHAHAHAHAHAHA. Pinapanood ko lang siyang mag laro sa tubig he even ask me a favor if i can take a picture of him -,- . Baliw nga talaga ako, siguro may sakit ako sa utak, basta ang alam ko lang ay nag date kami sa falls Hahhahaha yun na yun, hirap na kasi alalahanin mga nangyare. Malapit nanaman ang pasukan naiinip na ako ilang months lang huhu, July kasi ang pasukan namin dahil sa Covid 19 na yan, edi sana balik june nalang para hindi hassle. I cannot believe senior high na ako next School year, nga pala STEM ang kinuha kong strand, balak ko mag Neurosurgeon pero medtech muna or psychology para pag nag ka doctorate na ay pwede pa ako kumuha ng other jobs. Second choice ko nga pala ang law, magaling ako sa memorizing at reasoning kaso nga lang ms gusto ko talaga mag doctor, pero in the future pwede pa naman ako mag study ng law while doctor na. Pero gusto ko kasama kita abutin lahat ng yan, kaya ayusin mo rin buhay mo lime ah kikitain pa kita. </p>

</p> hello lime, naiiyak ako ngayon, nag layas ako:) life can be so unfair sometimes.. nag karoon ng rumor about saakin na may bf ako, even tho fake news lang, hindi ako pinaniwalaan? what do i expect diba, never naman ako pinakinggan buong buhay ko. Palagi nalang ako yung mali sa lahat, mas tinuring ko pang magulang mga ate ko kesa sa tunay kong ina. Ang sakit lime, ako nalang lagi, may nararamdaman din naman ako eh pero bakit ganun; nasagot ko sila kanina kaya nasaktan nanaman nila ako, hindi ko na kaya, kaya umalis nalang ako, hindi ko alam kung saan ako tutuloy ngayon, wala akong maisip puntahan dahil nahihiya ako sa mga kaiabigan ko, siguro ay sa lolo at lola ko nalang muna. Ako naman paborito nilang apo kaya alam kong tatanggapin nila ako dun, malas na malas talaga ako sa magulang ko, hindi ko manalang mreceived yung attention na gusto ko, palagai nalang silang busy sa trabaho, siguro napaka walang kwenta ko talaga. Sa movies lang naman nangyayare na naiispoiled yung bunso pero sa totoong buhay hindi, Alam mo bang mistake lang ako? mga ate at kuya ko Zennisca ang namang surname, for sure isa sakanila ang mag mamana ng mga ari arian ng zennisca, samantalang ako? naligaw ako ng landas, napapansin nila bakit ako lang nag iisang mendez Hahhahahaha, simula ng mawala sa mundong to father ng mga kapatid ko, nag pakalasing nanay ko, anong ending? nabuo ako kaya no choice silang mag pakasal ng tatay ko. Do you know na dumating pa sa point na gusto nila akong ipalaglag? pero umayaw yung mga kapatid ko. Hindi naman siguro halata na ayaw nila saakin diba? Although mas mayaman pa ang pamilya mendez kesa sa zennisca, nakaklaungkot naman dahil mag isa lang ako. ako ang pinaka batang mendez dito sa cagayan. Ako nalang ang nag iisang lalaking pwedeng mag kalat ng lahi namin. haystt malalman mo na kwnto ko HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA sana ayos ka lang diyan, nag hihirap na ako dito pero dapat ikaw okay lang. Tutuloy na mun ako sa bahay ng lolo ko </p>

</p> hi lime, nanaginip ako about kay yg, he told me that his birthday is in the month of july, not so sure pero yun talaga ang alam kong sinabi niya. Why the hell did this person keep on dropping informations? Possible bang totoong tao si Yg? Nahh ah, things are starting to get weirder. Yg is haunting me in my dreams every night, meron talagang kakaiba sa fictional character na to, habang tumatagal mas nagiging weird yung feeling pag kasama siya sa panaginip ko. </p>

</p> Here's the thing about waiting: while it requires so much out of you, it also pours something into you: an unshakeable strength that grows more steady with time. And you might not see it in the moment. You might not feel strength filling you up like fresh water from the spring, but that doesn't mean it is not growing within you, so that you can carry on another minute, another hour, another day. You might feel that your time has been wasted, that you would be much better off if you were further along. And the truth is, there is no way of really knowing how different things would be if you were somehow able to go back and fix or undo something, or change someone's mind, but no matter how idyllic the landscape is that you have painted in your mind of what could have been, there is so much growth that happens when you can let it go, and embrace the reality that here, in the now, there is still a life worth living for. There is still hope for the future. And the more you are able to do this, the more you will grow in strength, even while you are waiting.. </p>

</p> Merry Christmas my love, 2 months nalang, worth it lahat lahat ng paghihintay, malapit na. nalulungkot ako kasi walang celebration pero normal naman na saakin to, enjoy your christmas eve!I want the best for you. I want that happiness to enter your life, no matter how it manifests itself—as a person, an object, an experience, or another emotion. I wish love to overflow into you.not only your emotions. Instead, I want you to be completely filled with love—a living, breathing embodiment of my admiration. You should discover your passion. And for that desire to ignite a fire inside of you, that is strong enough to run through your veins. I want you to succeed in whatever that you set out to do. so that nothing and nobody can stand in the way of your goals. I desire for you to be sucessful. Everybody has different expectations from life, and that's okay, lime. However, I hope you succeed in achieving whatever it is you're aiming for. I want you to allow your inner strength to expand if you've discovered it. and if you haven't discovered it yet, keep trying; it's there, concealed beneath the layers of self-doubt and fears; all you need to do is discover it within yourself to unearth the gem that is your heart. Every time you glance in the mirror, may it bring you joy and happiness. for you to discover a place in your heart for self-love. Above all, though, I just want you to be happy. </p>

If wala ka sa place na yun saan ako mag hihintay? btw sabi ng ate ko ay pupunta muna kami sa falls dito sa island. Not so sure pero tamulaya.. or tamalayan thingy.. basta falls. HAHAHHAHAHAHA basta yung name na malapit sa name na yan, would you be there kaya? Bukas ko itutuloy pag hahanap sayo, ngayon ay mag babakasyon muna ako, weeks naman kami dito kaya no rush.

</p> lime.. something weird happened yesterday sa falls, familiar yung lugar, natatandaan mo ba ikwinento ko about kay yg? yung panaginip ko? nakalimutan ko anong month pero kung binasa mo yun ay maaalala mo. The falls one!. You won't believe it. Kaya pala familiar dahil same na same yung place. Tandang tanda ko yung matataas na puno ng niyog, yung green grass na dadaanan mo bago ka makatungtong sa falls, isa yun sa naaalala ko. How come?? Nahh my cyclothymia is acting up again. Hindi ako nag enjoy ngayon. ayoko na litong lito na ako. Sino ba talaga ang hinahanap ko ikaw ba lime o si yg. May mga tanong na gusto ko masagot? bakit parang ibang tao ang hinahanap ko? bakit parang mali ako ng tinatahak na direskiyon> Ang gulo lime promise. Pero baka dahil lang ito sa pagod. Pagod na pagod ako ngayon. Mag papahinga nalang muna ako at hahanapin pa kita bukas. </p>

</p> Hi lime, still.. wala pa rin. no signs of you. Nawawalan na ako ng pag asa, hindi ko alam kung kakayanin ko pa, lime paano ako? paano ako pag hindi kita nakita? lime tatlong taon yun:( please nag mamakaawa ako mag pakita ka na sakin ohh, hindi naman ako humihiling ng malaki gusto lang talaga kitang makita.  I wish I could explain what waiting feels like. I wish I could tell you that it feels like i’m losing hope, that it feels like every second and hour i have  experience is just a waste. I wish I could tell you that waiting is tiring, you never requested it but what can i do? i’m sorry.. Hindi ko din alam bakit ginagawa ko to, I am losing it. Kung hindi man tayo mag kita sa mga susunod na araw gusto lang kita pasalamatan. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for changing the direction of my existence towards something better.You've allowed me to grow in many ways that I don't know what I was doing before. I thought that I had things figured out, I thought I knew exactly where I was going thought that the flow of my current life was at its best. But you came and everything became crystal clear. I realised that I could become an even better version of myself, I accepted my imperfections and understood what it means to let growth in, to let lessons teach you things, to let love in. I valued my dreams more and became determined in ways I never thought possible. I became more whole in myself than I've ever been before. And I know that it's down to me - the hard work, the hours I put in, the way I treat people, the value that I give myself. But still, I thank you because you brought to light this side of me. I want to thank you, because I didn't know how much impact another person could have on your life until I met you. I want to thank, because you really are something special. </p>

</P> Hi, words cannot explain how I feel right now. In a serendipitous twist of fate, I stumbled upon the person I had been fervently seeking. It was as if the universe had orchestrated our paths to intersect at the perfect moment. the glow of happiness that illuminated the shadows of my past searches. I-...I found him and him. All of my questions suddenly disappeared. I can't believe the book I'm writing will be our story. I can't believe that the 2 people I have been waiting... are alike... I mean no. Yg and Lime are just one fucking person.  After years of waiting, after several breakdowns, after endless dreams, I finally understand why. The stars in the universe aligned for us. Yg I don't know if Magiging masaya ba ako o malulungkot, how? how did this happen... Hindi naman to kasama sa plano ko? Hindi man lang pumasok sa isip ko na baka ikaw nga si lime, na baka nga iisa lang talaga kayo. Naiiyak ako, hindi ko maexplain lahat. Hindi ko alam sasabihin ko. Natutulala nalang ako, andaming nagbago sayo, ibang iba ka na sa nakilala ko. Lime:( I missed you, I missed you so much. You grew up well. Mas pumuti ka, mas kuminis ka, ang tangkad tangkad mo na, andaming nag bago sa tatlong taon, naiiyak na ako..nahanap rin kita, alam mo ba kung gaano ako kasaya kanina? Halos humiwalay na kaluluwa ko kakatalon. Naka puti ka, ganun parin ang lakad mo, similar na similar kay yg, body structure mo? kuhang kuha mo lahat, lalo na at nahagip ka ng araw. The golden hour vibes are coming back... Lime thank youu, thank you at nag pakita ka. There are places I thought I was destined to, for which I was never meant. There are people I thought would ride with me forever, but at the first junction upped and left. There are hardships I thought would last a lifetime, but with time were swiftly swept. There are plans I thought I had all set-out, but those were not the cards of life I was dealt. There are times I thought things would end up differently, but I now understand God always knows the perfect timing. Sometimes we think that life isn't in our favor because what we wanted hasn't worked out. But that's when we need to have the utmost faith that everything happening at that particular moment is not only in our favor but it's what's meant for us. And it might not make sense to us right then, or even weeks and months down the line. But one day we will look back at this time and be grateful that what we wanted didn't happen. Because everything worked out for the best. It always does. Hindi tayo pinagtagpo noon, dahil ngayon ang tamang panahon.I always believed that the people who are meant to be in your life will find their way back to you. They have to. Because the laws of nature have decided that maybe this time was not yours, maybe this moment was not meant for love but for something else. Maybe these stages of both your lives are there to prepare you for different battles - but you will come together again. You will learn, grow, heal and perhaps even love others before you find your way back to each other. Before the years have spilled into the crevices of your journeys and you have so much to catch up on, so much to learn about each other that you missed out on. Before they realize that the 'you' they left behind is no longer the 'you' they find - because of the different shades of growth you experienced. The people who are meant for you, the ones whose journey takes them on a new course altogether, will find you again. Because there is nowhere else for them to go. Because they can trek down as many stormy paths as they are meant to, but they will still not find the home that they had made with you. Because you both have to learn, change, and mend into the right people for each other. The people who are meant for you will travel to the edges of the earth and still come back to you. Because they have to. They do. Meeting you lime was never an accident. </p>
